# Overriding Pod properties

To suit your needs, you may need to override or complete some
properties filled to the underlying Pod. The `podOverrides`
property of both the `ProxyFleet` and `MinecraftServerFleet`
allows you to customize the Pod properties as you were writing
a Pod directly (i.e. the supported sub-properties are identical
to the Pod specification).

You can find all the properties overridable by looking at the
`shulker-crds` package of the repository:

- [ProxyFleet](https://github.com/jeremylvln/Shulker/blob/main/packages/shulker-crds/src/v1alpha1/proxy_fleet.rs)
- [MinecraftServerFleet](https://github.com/jeremylvln/Shulker/blob/main/packages/shulker-crds/src/v1alpha1/minecraft_server_fleet.rs)

## Adding environment variables

Shulker already injects some environment variables that could
be useful. But adding your own is fully supported:

```yaml
apiVersion: shulkermc.io/v1alpha1
kind: MinecraftServerFleet
metadata:
  name: my-server
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: my-cluster
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec: // [!code focus]
      podOverrides: // [!code focus]
        env: // [!code focus]
          - name: OPENMATCH_HOST // [!code focus]
            value: open-match-frontend.open-match.svc // [!code focus]
          - name: OPENMATCH_PORT // [!code focus]
            value: '50504' // [!code focus]
```

## Setting custom affinities

By default, Agones adds a _preferred_ scheduling on nodes
labelled with `agones.dev/role=gameserver`. However you
may want to customize more the scheduling behavior.

For instance, you may want to restrict some servers to some
nodes:

```yaml
apiVersion: shulkermc.io/v1alpha1
kind: MinecraftServerFleet
metadata:
  name: my-server
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: my-cluster
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec: // [!code focus]
      podOverrides: // [!code focus]
        affinity: // [!code focus]
          nodeAffinity: // [!code focus]
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: // [!code focus]
              nodeSelectorTerms: // [!code focus]
                - matchExpressions: // [!code focus]
                    - key: devops.example.com/gameserver // [!code focus]
                      operator: In // [!code focus]
                      values: // [!code focus]
                        - my-server // [!code focus]
        tolerations: // [!code focus]
          - key: "devops.example.com/gameserver" // [!code focus]
            operator: "Equal" // [!code focus]
            value: "my-server" // [!code focus]
            effect: "NoSchedule" // [!code focus]
```

## Customizing agones health check

Agones uses a health check to determine if a server is ready and healthy.
You may want to customize the health check to better suit your needs
(e.g. your server takes 1 minute to start, you may want to increase the `initial_delay_seconds` to 60).

```yaml
apiVersion: shulkermc.io/v1alpha1
kind: MinecraftServerFleet
metadata:
  name: my-server
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: my-cluster
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec: // [!code focus]
      podOverrides: // [!code focus]
        health: // [!code focus]
          disabled: false // [!code focus]
          initial_delay_seconds: 30 // [!code focus]
          period_seconds: 15 // [!code focus]
          failureThreshold: 5 // [!code focus]
```

## Mounting volumes <Badge type="tip" text="servers" />

Additional volumes can be injected to the `MinecraftServer`'s
created `Pod`:

```yaml
apiVersion: shulkermc.io/v1alpha1
kind: MinecraftServer
metadata:
  name: my-server
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: my-cluster
  podOverrides: // [!code focus]
    volumeMounts: // [!code focus]
      - name: my-extra-volume // [!code focus]
        mountPath: /mnt/path // [!code focus]
    volumes: // [!code focus]
      - name: my-extra-volume // [!code focus]
        emptyDir: {} // [!code focus]
```

:::warning

Agones, and thus Shulker, are not meant for data persistence but
rather ephemeral workload. While adding custom volumes to a `MinecraftServer`
is expected to work perfectly, adding some to a `MinecraftServerFleet`
will only work if your volume source support multiple mounts (it is
essentially the same as mounting the same volume to a `Deployment`).
