# Installation

Shulker is composed of multiple components, some of them being
optional. By design, only the **Shulker Operator** is required
to be installed as it contains the core logic.

## Shulker Operator

The **Shulker Operator** can be installed using **Kustomize**:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jeremylvln/Shulker
$ kubectl apply -k Shulker/kube/overlays/stable -n shulker-system
```

:::tip

If Prometheus is installed (along with its custom CRDs), you
would prefer selecting the `stable-with-prometheus` overlay which
will create appropriate `ServiceMonitor`s resources.

:::

After this, a `shulker-operator` Pod should be scheduled and
work immediately.

:::info

The operator Pod requires a certificate from cert-manager to
be provisionned, it may take some seconds/minutes to generate.
If the certificate is still not available after some minutes,
check your cert-manager logs. There is no special configuration
expected, a default installation should work out-of-the-box.
