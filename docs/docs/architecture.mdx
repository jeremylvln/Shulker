A **Shulker Cluster** is composed of three main _entities_:

1. The **Cluster**, represented by the **MinecraftCluster** CRD (in purple
   in the diagram above) is the primary entity defining some global
   settings of the cluster. At least one is mandatory as most CRDs
   will requires you to provide the name of the **Cluster** to
   attach to.
2. The **Proxy**, represented by the **Proxy** CRD (in orange in the diagram
   above) is an entrypoint for the players to connect to. A proxy will initiate
   connections to the **Servers**.
3. The **Server**, represented by the **MinecraftServer** CRD (in green in the
   diagram above) is a Minecraft Server by itself. They are ephemeral and
   don't have any persistent storage. They should be destroyed and created
   on demand.

If you pay close attention to the **Proxies** and **MinecraftServers**, you'll
see that each resource represent only one entity under the hood. This means that
one **Proxy** CRD equals to everything needed to run only one proxy ; simplified
as most as possible, this means that one CRD equals to one **Kubernetes Pod**.

By design, these two resources are ephemeral. Once their associated **Kubernetes
Pod** is unscheduled (either because it exited successfully or not), they are
themselves destroyed. This is to ensure the velocity and scalability of your
Shulker Cluster.

They are "grouped" alternatives to single proxies and servers named
**ProxyDeployment** and **MinecraftServerDeployment**. Like **Kubernetes Deployments**,
these CRDs will ensure that, at a given time, there is always a fixed number
of available replicas.

## What is exactly a Cluster?

A Cluster (meaning the **MinecraftCluster** CRD), is the root entity of a Minecraft
Network: every proxy and server needs one to attach to. It could define global
settings multiple sub-entities may need.

:::caution

From a Kubernetes point-of-view, you can have multiple Clusters in a same
**Kubernetes Namespace**.

While it is possible, it will make harder to distinguish which resource is owned
by which cluster and could go as far as causing issues if some clusters are fighting
for the same resource (if two clusters want to have the same secret name, for instance).

:::

:::note

Currently, the **MinecraftCluster** do not do much things, however it is planned
in the future to let it manage a **Limbo mechanism**. A Limbo is a piece of software
emulating a Minecraft Server without any game logic. Its only purpose is to keep the
player connected to the Network while having an almost-zero performance impact.

## Keeping the proxies up-to-date

One of the core requirements of Shulker is to keep the proxies up-to-date about all
the creation and deletion of servers. This is usually done manually using the following
flow:

1. A Minecraft server is started with a custom plugin
2. When the Minecraft server is ready, the custom plugin will contact all the proxies
   for them to **add** _you_ in their server list
3. When a player will want to connect to the new server, the proxy will already know
   it and establish the connection
4. When the Minecraft server is shutting down, the same custom plugin will contact all
   the proxies for them to **remove** _you_ form their server list

While this could _easily_ be done by you with custom development, you'll still have to:
create a custom plugin for this purpose, figure out how to broadcast the information to
all the proxies, have a way of retrieving the IP address the proxy should use to connect
players to the server, have a recovery mechanism to handle crashed servers that may not
have informed proxies to remove them for their list.

Shulker, through Kubernetes, knows every proxy and every server along with their
availability. Supported by a plugin agent to be installed on every proxy, the proxies
will have their server list updated immediately upon every event occuring in the
Kubernetes Cluster.

:::caution

While servers are synchronized on each proxies, players are not. This means that,
from one proxy, you will **not** know that another player is connected to the network
if it is not connected to the same proxy. **This feature is considered high priority.**

## Proxy and Server extensibility

Shulker is only useful if it allows you to configure your proxies and servers
freely. For the servers, this means that you should have a way of configuring
anything from the game mode to the map to download on startup, like you would do
manually by managing all the servers yourself.

In the background, we use the Docker images of **[itzg](https://github.com/itzg)**,
an open-source developper which has developed Docker images for Minecraft proxies
and servers. These images will handle automatically the software download (like
fetching automatically your favorite Bukkit or BungeeCord version) while the
configuration is solely managed by Shulker.

See the appropriate **Recipes** of this documentation to know what could be
configured.
